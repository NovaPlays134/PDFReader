# PDFReader
A Script for the mod menu Stand that allows you to webhook detections/classifications, new sessions and the in game chat.

You can exclude what u want, when you join a new session it will show all players, session code and what kind of session it is (online, story mode, online in a session alone).

I prevented that your webhook URL does not get saved into your profile to prevent you accidentally sending it to someone i did this by storing it on a txt file you get with the script.

# Installation
You click the green button that says "code" and then you press the "Download ZIP" this will download the script onto your computer now extract the zip file and drop the NovaHook.pluto file, resources folder and store folder in the Lua Scripts folder in the Stand folder you can open the Lua Scripts folder with the Stand Launchpad.
